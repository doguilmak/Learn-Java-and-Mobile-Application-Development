In this repository, I will share with you what we did with **Barış Mert Bozbaş** step by step in the **Mobile Application Development** course taught by **Kerim Kürşat Çevik** at **Akdeniz University**. In addition, this repository contains the first seven weeks and three examples of midterm questions. It will be our pleasure to be your partner in this process. If you have anything to add, please share with us.

**Course 1**
 - [10-01-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-01-2021) - The basic operators made in this course.

**Course 2**
 - [10-05-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-05-2021) - In the course 2, it is aimed to randomly give $6$ numbers from the integers from $1$ to $49$ without duplicated numbers.

**Course 3**
 - [10-06-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-06-2021) - In the course 3, we were tried to build a basic calculator that can only add numbers with using keyboard inputs.

**Course 4**
 - [10-08-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-08-2021) - This week, we created the algorithm that can make $5x5$ matrix with random integers between $0$ and $24$. In the algorithm, first we were tried to make $5x5$ matrix from $0$ to $24$ without random order. Then, we made it with random utility.

**Course 5**
 - [10-12-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-12-2021) - This course focuses on creating functions. As an example, functions that make addition, subtraction and factorial calculation have been created.

**Course 6**
 - [10-18-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/10-18-2021) - This week, we created the algorithm that can give $6$ random values between stated parameters without repeated numbers.

**Course 7**
 - [11-02-2021](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/11-02-2021) - This week, we created the algorithm which can make calculations on circles and spheres on radius. The circumference and area of the circle, the volume and the surface area of the sphere were calculated over the radius variable `r`. This calculation was made via a class called `cember`.

**Course 8 - Midterm Projects**
 - [Project 1](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/Midterm-Projects/project_1) - This exercise is one of the studies that the professor asked us to do in preparation for the midterm exam. This exercise is game-based. When two dice are rolled in the game **if their total is $7$ or $11$, it is won. If the total is $2$, $3$, or $12$, it is lost. If the total is $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, $10$, the player continues to roll the dice.** In addition, we have the right to roll the dice $4$ times in total in the game.

 - [Project 2](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/Midterm-Projects/project_2) - This exercise is one of the studies that the professor asked us to do in preparation for the midterm exam. This exercise is game-based. **A lucky ball game is a numerical game based on choosing a specified number of numbers from two different sets of numbers. The first set of numbers consists of numbers $1-34$, and the second set of numbers consists of numbers $1-14$. Participants will be able to participate in the game by choosing $5$ numbers from the first set of numbers and $1$ number from the second set of numbers. They can play a maximum of $10$ games in a column**. An algorithm has been created for the user to play the chance ball game automatic.

 - [Project 3](https://github.com/doguilmak/Learn-Java-in-Mobile-Application-Development-Course/tree/main/Midterm-Projects/project_3) - This exercise is one of the studies that the professor asked us to do in preparation for the midterm exam. This exercise is game-based. **In this game, city names consisting of $5$ letters are tried to be guessed. This process is prepared like a hangman game.**
